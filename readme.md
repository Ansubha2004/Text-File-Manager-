# Text File Manager

The Text File Manager is a backend-powered web application designed to manage text files efficiently within a local directory. It allows users to:

1. Create new .txt files by entering a filename and content through a simple form.

2. Read existing files with just one click.

3. Edit files (can be extended as a future feature).

4. Delete individual files or bulk delete all files from the directory.

Built using Node.js, Express, and EJS templating, this project demonstrates foundational backend concepts such as file system operations (fs module), dynamic rendering, and form handling. The UI is styled using Tailwind CSS for responsiveness and clean layout.
This project serves as practical backend development practice for handling server-side file operations and routing logic.
